1) create  new repo
2) enable Git
3) connect to Github (remote)
4) create a new branch and:
  - add gitignore (commit)
  - add a md file (commit)
  - add information to md file and make more commits
5) push (the branch) to origin
6) merge in Github
7) pull to your master (updating your master)
8) make a new branch and:
  - new vagrant file
9) add/commit and push to origin again
10) merge in Github
11) update your master again


## branches
 - git checkout -b branchname --> this will add a branch to your master
 - git checkout branchname --> this moves to your desired branch
 - git push origin branchname --> if you have an origin (github) this will push your branch to the origin WITHOUT MERGING (merging is done on github)
### once branch is in github - you can merge branches to master

### once back in master on your terminal
 - git pull origin master --> this will pull your github origin/master to your terminal master (match up the timelines)
